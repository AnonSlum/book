	<p>Hey there! Welcome to our website that is all about African cultures. The sentence you just read is in Xitsonga, one of the many beautiful languages spoken in our continent. It roughly translates to "welcome to our website about African cultures".
		Now, let me tell you a little bit about a children's book that I, <b>Alby Mavimbela</b>, have written. It's called "Hello, Welcome to Africa" and it's all about Africa as the great society, and a continent.</p>
  <p>In our books, we celebrate the rich culture and diversity of Africa through children's literature. Our main series delves into the importance of African unity and how it shapes the continent and its people.

		Our first installment, "Hello, Welcome to Africa" follows the journey of two young children as they travel through the continent, meeting different tribes and indigenous people, learning their names and how they greet. It's a heartwarming story that promotes understanding and acceptance of different cultures.</p>

		<p>In "Bon Apetit," we explore the importance of sharing and commensality, as friends from all over Africa come together to share food from their beautiful cultural backgrounds. Food is a powerful tool that connects people to their culture and heritage, and this story teaches children the importance of appreciating and embracing different cultures.

		Our third installment, "Great Kings of Africa," takes us on a journey through history as we learn about some of the most powerful and influential kings that have shaped the continent. It's a story that teaches children about leadership, courage, and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage.

		In all of our stories, we aim to promote understanding and acceptance of different cultures, and to instill a sense of pride in our African heritage. We hope you enjoy reading them as much as we enjoyed writing them!</p>
